        <label class="question">What is Android Network Traces?</label>
        <p class="answer">
          Android sers may see notifcations of apps trying to access their data
          on a daily basis. However, it's difficult for users to know
          <b>what</b> kind of data is being collected by those apps, and
          <b>why</b> the data is being collected. <br />
          The goal of our application is to educate users about what kind of
          network activity is being carried out by android apps. We present
          queryable data visualizations of 'where' and 'why' data is being sent.

        <label class="question">How did you collect data from apps?</label>
        <p class="answer">
          The most common way for smartphone apps to communicate with the cloud
          servers is HTTP(S) request. We use VPN to intercept outgoing these
          HTTP(S) traffic requests and then parse the body of requests into
          key-value pairs.<br />
          The entire dataset is now made public. You can find it on
          <a href="https://github.com/CMUChimpsLab/mobipurpose" target="_blank"
            >github</a
          >.

          >How did you process the collected data for analysis?</label
        >
        <p class="answer">
          For each the key-value pair parsed from HTTP requests, we perform a
          taxonomy look-up to assign this request a data type. The taxonomy used
          is built by a group of researchers and students at Carnegie Mellon
          University. In this example, a request with the key being
          <b>'userAdvertisingID' </b> will be categorized as
          <b>AdvertisingID</b> under the <b>PhoneID</b> datatype.

        <label class="question"
          >How did you predict the data-collection purpose?</label
        >
        <p class="answer">
          Based on the identified data type, we use a supervised machine
          learning algorithm to predict the possibility for each candidate
          purpose and output the most likely one. Our testing results show that
          algorithm can predict the data collection purpose with an average
          precision of 84% (among 19 unique categories).

      <div class="faq-question">
        <label class="question">How often do you refresh your data?</label>
        <p class="answer">
          Our predictative results are based on the one-time analysis of the
          dataset
          <a href="https://github.com/CMUChimpsLab/mobipurpose" target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >. We assume the data type sent to the cloud services and the data
          collection purposes to be quite static. If we update the raw dataset
          in the future, we will put up a notice for update.

        <label class="question"
          >Why can't I find information of the app I'm looking for?</label
        >
        <p class="answer">
          We only collected data from about 10,000 android apps. It's likely
          that the app your are looking for was added after our data collection
          process.
