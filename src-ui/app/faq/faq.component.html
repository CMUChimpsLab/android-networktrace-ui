                        The goal of this web-app is to educate users about what sort of network activity is being carried out by
                        their apps. We present queryable data visualizations of 'where' and 'why' data is being sent.

                    <label class="question">How did you collect data from smart phone apps to conduct analysis?</label>
                    <p class="answer">
                        The most common way for smartphone apps to communicate with the cloud servers is HTTP(S) request. 
                        We use VPN to intercept outgoing these HTTP(S) traffic requests and then parse the body of
                        requests into key-value pairs.

                    <label class="question">How did you analyze the collected data ?</label>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Based on the identified data type, we use a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the data collection purpose.

                        Currently the data we collected is not user-specific. However, you can use the search bar to check 
                        for a specific app you are looking for.
