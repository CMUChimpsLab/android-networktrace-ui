                        Many smartphone apps collect and send a great deal of data to third-party websites. The goal of
                        this site is to help people better understand Who knows What about us and Why. By Who, we mean
                        these third-party websites. By What, we mean what data they are collecting about us. By Why, we
                        mean the purpose of this data collection, e.g. for advertising, for maps, for backups, and so
                        on.

                        We accessed approximately 15 thousand apps, which sent 6.3 million network traces to 12 thousand
                        domains. These apps were selected automatically because they generally did not require login,
                        were compatible with Android 7, and could be installed over the course of 50 days. Full

                        We collected data using 8 phones, an automation tool for clicking through apps, and a custom VPN
                        for intercepting data.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Phones and apps:</b> In November 2016, we crawled the Google Play store to find free apps
                            visible to US users. Out of the 185,000 apps free apps updated after 2015, 30,000 apps were
                            compatible with Android 7 and were thus installed on eight phones. Network traces were found
                            from half of these apps.</li>
                        <li><b>Automation tool:</b> Each phone contained an automation tool called a “UI monkey”. The UI
                            monkey could install an app, randomly click through it for 3 minutes, and then uninstall it.
                            We ran the UI monkeys for 50 days.</li>
                        <li><b>Custom VPN:</b> As the UI monkeys clicked through the apps, the phones sent data across
                            the internet. The most common way for smartphone apps to communicate with cloud servers is
                            through HTTP(S) requests. Therefore, we built a custom tool (or “man-in-the-middle VPN”) to
                            intercept these outgoing HTTP(S) traffic requests.</li>

                    <p>This approach is novel in its ability to not only assess which data leaves the phones but also
                        collect millions of data points. A limitation is that UI monkeys miss some screens in an app.
                        Additionally, these bots were generally not logged into the apps.</p>

                        The responses (i.e. network traces) that our VPN intercepted were parsed as key-value pairs. For
                        each pair, we performed a taxonomy look-up to assign a data type. For example, a key of latitude
                        could have a value of 40.460865 and be classified as “Location data”.

                        Mobile advertisements can occur as text-based ads, banner advertisements, videos, which accounts
                        for approximately two-thirds (65%) of 2018’s internet ad revenues. To tailor the advertisement
                        for individual users, developers frequently collect users’ online/offline behavior data (e.g.,
                        browsing history, GPS trajectory) and associate them with unique IDs stored in mobile devices.

                        Collecting usage data for analytic purposes is another common practice in today’s software
                        industry. Developers often collect various information, such as device models, user
                        interactions, and device IDs, to monitor and track software bugs.

                        Yes. Although this study did not collect those data, data types such as microphone, camera, and
                        contacts are in our research taxonomy. The next step would be replacing the UI monkeys with
                        humans or more sophisticated bots and collecting more data.
